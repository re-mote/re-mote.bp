To build and run a project:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) must be installed.

2. Run the command `$ yarn` in the project folder.

3. After installing all the packages:
  - `$ gulp build` - to build the project. The folder "public" will appear, which will contain the entire layout in HTML / CSS / JS format.
  - `$ gulp dev` - to build the project and run it on the local server. After launching, the page with the compiled project should automatically open in the browser (usually it's [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
